# Predicting House Prices

In this project we are going to predict house prices from district of California by training and

testing an appropriate machine learning model on a data set containing information on more than 20.000

districts in California.



Each data point is district in California and the color displace the median

house prices and the districts and dark blue stands for lower house prices and dark red for high house

prices are expensive districts.

And actually we try to understand why some districts are more expensive than others.

And we try to find the most important features that determine house prices, for instance, the location

or the median income.

And finally, we are going to train and test the machine learning model with Sckit learn that allows

us to predict prices for districts where we don't have any information on house prices.

But the main focus is on:
1) importing and inspecting the data set.

2) explanatory data analysis with Pendas and Seabourne to understand the data and to select and create appropriate features and also to select an appropriate model.

3) data preprocessing and feature engineering with Pandas.
